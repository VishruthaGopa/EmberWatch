# EmberWatch
EmberWatch is a application developed during the **Set.hacks() hackathon**, where it secured **1st Place Overall in Persona #2 category**. This powerful and interactive tool raises awareness and tracks forest fires in Canada, providing users with an insightful map to explore information on known wildfires based on location and a specified time range.

## Features
- **Interactive Map:** Explore a dynamic map that visualizes the information on wildfires throughout Canada.
- **Location Awareness:** The map starts the user at the IP location of their device for a personalized experience.
- **Time Range Customization:** Users can change the time range to observe patterns and trends of wildfires over the years.
- **Efficient Data Rendering:** Despite handling a vast amount of data, EmberWatch efficiently renders information without compromising load speeds.

## How It Works
EmberWatch is designed with a frontend, backend, and a combination of both to deliver a seamless user experience.

### Frontend Components:
- Developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for the main webpage.

### Backend Components:
- Utilized Python for managing and organizing data.
- Implemented the Distributed Compute Protocol (DCP) to calculate distances between fires and the user's location.

### Map Creation:
- The interactive map was created to display and interact with the data effectively.
