            <p style = "color:green;font-family:verdana;">In recent years, the climate on our beloved Earth has started to change for the worse. 
                Climate change has been shown to affect wildfires, due to the increased amount of droughts, and higher overall temperatures. 
                Studies have shown that in the more recent years, fires have been getting larger, more severe, more frequent, and more dangerous.
            </p>
            <p style = "color:green;font-family:verdana;">This dilemma that the world has to face is what inspired us to create EmberWatch, an extremely helpful fire visualization tool capable of displaying wildfires that have happened all around Canada throughout the past century. 
                Canada is one of the world's leading producers and exporters of wood, with the industry accounting for about $23.7 billion of the country's GDP in 2019. 
                Due to the natural risk that comes with such an important industry, we felt that our project would be able to make an impact on local enterprises, and populations who live in high risk areas.
